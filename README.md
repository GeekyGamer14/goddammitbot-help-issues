God Dammit Bot Help
===================

Welcome! This document will show you all the wonderful things God Dammit can do.

God Dammit's Backstory
----------------------

Ever wonder why God Dammit is named God Dammit? (I'm sure you have, don't lie.) Well, it all started in science class. I was with my friend James, we had a substitute. The sub said "If you get called by something else, please tell me." My friend then proceeded to say "My name is James but my friends call me-", suddenly he realized he forgot his homework, "GOD DAMMIT!". The sentence came out as "My name is James but my friends call me GOD DAMMIT!". Yes, the bot's profile picture is an actual picture of him and yes, I had his permission to use it.

How to Use the God Dammit Bot
-------------------------

This bot doesn't have many of the commands from the official and most community bots because if you have multiple bots in your cloud, it would get really messy.

Things to know:
- 3 does not exist
- The answer to #11 is ooooooooooooooooooooooooo
- Never question God Dammit
- 22 is my favorite color
- "Ms. Munson?" "No"
- Mommy needs to get you a discount.
- Sean is a bitch, a Mr. Bitch.

Command                         | Description
------------------------------- | -------------
`!calc [expression]`            | Calculate an expression, example `!calc 1+1`
`!help`                         | Shows a link to this page
